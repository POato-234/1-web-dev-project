            which is a netted structure positioned 10 feet above the ground.The game is played on a rectangular court,<br>
            with teams trying to move the ball towards the basket by dribbling (bouncing the ball while moving) <br>
            or passing it to teammates. The opposing team tries to block the ball or prevent scoring by playing defense. <br>
            The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.Basketball is played at various levels,<br>
            from informal pick-up games to professional leagues like the NBA (National Basketball Association) <br>
