<!-- explains what the topic is about -->
    <p style="font-size: 18px;">Basketball is a fast-paced sport played by two teams, typically consisting of five players on each side.</br >
            The objective of the game is to score points by shooting the ball through the opposing team's hoop or basket,<br>
            which is a netted structure positioned 10 feet above the ground.The game is played on a rectangular court,<br>
            with teams trying to move the ball towards the basket by dribbling (bouncing the ball while moving) <br>
            or passing it to teammates. The opposing team tries to block the ball or prevent scoring by playing defense. <br>
            The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.Basketball is played at various levels,<br>
            from informal pick-up games to professional leagues like the NBA (National Basketball Association) <br>
            in the United States. It’s popular worldwide and known for its exciting, high-energy plays, such as dunks,<br>
            three-pointers, and fast breaks.</p>

    <span style="text-decoration: underline; color: #561e1f;">
        <p style="font-size: 18px;">Since basketball is a team sport, it fosters communication and collaboration. Players must work <br>
        together to succeed, sharing strategies and helping each other. This teaches valuable social skills like listening, <br>
        problem-solving, and teamwork, all of which are useful in personal and professional life.</p>
